I have used a dataset which conatins various features such as Car_Name,Year,Selling_Price,Present_Price,Kms_Driven,Fuel_Type,Seller_Type,Transmission	Owner

Then i have done preprocessing on data and then trained the model using different machine learning models 

I have a created a GUI using tkinter library for easy interaction.
